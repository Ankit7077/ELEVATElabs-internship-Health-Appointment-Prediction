****Project: **Predicting Medical Appointment "No-Shows"**
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict medical appointment "no-shows." By accurately identifying patients who are likely to miss their appointments, healthcare providers can implement targeted interventions to improve patient attendance, reduce wasted resources, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

The project utilizes a dataset of over 100,000 medical appointments and employs a data science pipeline that includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw data.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.

Model Training: Implementing a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance with key metrics.

Visualization: Presenting the findings in a clear, interactive Power BI dashboard.

**Methodology**
Data
The dataset consists of 106,987 medical appointment records, with features such as Age, Gender, Neighbourhood, and various health conditions. A key step involved addressing the significant class imbalance between "showed up" and "no-show" patients using resampling techniques like SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler.

**Model**
The primary model used is a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning algorithm known for its high accuracy and robustness. An alternative deep learning model was also developed using TensorFlow for comparative analysis.

**Evaluation**
The model was evaluated using standard metrics, including:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score: To measure the model's predictive power.

Confusion Matrix: To visualize classification results.

ROC-AUC Score: To assess the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

**Key Findings**
Suspicion of Data Leakage: The model achieved a perfect 100% accuracy, which is highly unlikely in a real-world scenario. This finding points to a potential data leakage issue that needs to be addressed before the model can be considered reliable.

SMS Reminders: Initial analysis revealed a counter-intuitive finding: patients who received an SMS reminder were slightly more likely to be no-shows.

Importance of Lead Time: The time between scheduling and the appointment date (Date.diff) appears to be a crucial factor in predicting attendance.

**Future Scope**
To enhance this project, future work will focus on:

Refactoring the Model: Identifying and removing the source of data leakage to build a more generalizable model.

Exploring Advanced Features: Incorporating new features like historical patient no-show data, weather, or transportation logistics.

Deployment: Packaging the final, validated model into an API for use in real-world applications like a hospital's scheduling software.

Browser Extension: Developing a browser extension to provide real-time predictions.

Model Monitoring: Implementing a system to monitor the model's performance in a live environment and retrain it as needed.
